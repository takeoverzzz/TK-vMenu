# TK-vMenu
The vMenu for Project Fairness \ takeoverz and other affiliated servers. All actions are subject to change.

# Description
The original vMenu was lacking on options and new content. I made this version as a way for people to still get the latest updates, while of course, adding new things so it feels more like the vMenu on other servers (such as RSM, Impulse99, etc) while also improving upon the original.

# DISCLAIMER 
- If you are going to use this version of TK-vMenu, make sure you set "vmenu_individual_server_id" in your permission.cfg file. Otherwise, vMenu will fail to start. This value can be any ASCII character and no spaces (ie. the name of the server, random string of letters and numbers). 
- Make sure you also update your "vmenu_menu_toggle_key" and "vmenu_noclip_toggle_key". If you're an existing vMenu/TK-vMenu user, these have been changed to use [Keyboard Controls](https://docs.fivem.net/docs/game-references/input-mapper-parameter-ids/keyboard/)
- This release is also based on the v3.6.0 release of vMenu. We had to do a whole bunch of porting from our v3.5.1 pre-release into this.

## Compiling of the TK-vMenu
Compiling the vMenu is quite easy and straight-forward, if you have Visual Studio. By grabbing the NuGet packages for CitizenFX.Core.Client and CitizenFX.Core.Server as well as the NuGet package for MenuAPI, all you have to do is compile and that's it. All support of the Project Fairness vMenu will never be receiving troubleshoot support by Vespura, so do not bother asking for support to him. This is a fork of his project. Please pull a Issue request if you have any problems with this vMenu.

## Support
If you like Vespura's work, please consider supporting him on [**Patreon**](https://www.patreon.com/vespura). He's put a _lot_ of my time and hard work into his vMenu and other projects.

## Pull Requests
We are glad at accepting Pull Requests to add more features overtime to our vMenu, meaning we can add more features that can be similar to other vMenu clients.

# vMenu
vMenu is server sided menu for FiveM servers, including full\* permission support.

\*(Some features do not have permissions support as they are either harmless or it'd just be silly to deny them. However, they will be disabled if you deny access to the submenu that they are a part of (eg: unlimited stamina in Player Options will be disabled if you deny `vMenu.PlayerOptions.Menu`.))

The intention of this vMenu is to create the ultimate vMenu from Vespura's resources, while also achieving the same features seen on other servers such as Rockstar Mischief and Impulse99, which have a modified vMenu, while adding and integrating new features inside of said vMenu.

## MenuAPI
Starting from vMenu v2.1.0, vMenu will be using [MenuAPI (MAPI)](https://github.com/TomGrobbe/MenuAPI), a custom menu API designed specifically for vMenu by me.

vMenu v2.0.0 and earlier was [using a modified version of NativeUI](https://github.com/TomGrobbe/NativeUI), originally by [Guad](https://github.com/Guad/NativeUI), but converted to FiveM by the CitizenFX Collectives and myself (updated/refactored).
